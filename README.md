# ElectronicsProject_faceReco
This project uses face recognition to identify players and move a tower based on their match with stored faces. An Intel RealSense camera captures images, and a deep learning model compares faces. If a match is found, the tower rises via a serial connection. The game lasts four rounds, then the score is calculated, and the tower resets.
